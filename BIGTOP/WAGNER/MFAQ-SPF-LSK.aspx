    <h3>Q: "Can you recommend which passive crossover I should use with the drivers you sell?"</h3>

<p>Unfortunately we can't make specific recommendations when seeking to pair the drivers we sell with generic 2 or 3 way passive crossover boards.</p>

<p>Many customers like to use the generic crossovers we sell as a simple and low cost way to try out the drivers in our store. It should be understood that this will never provide an ideal result and that 95% of the time one of our professionally designed kits will offer much greater performance. The result of&nbsp;using a generic crossover will vary from good to poor. If you want high performance, then it's essential to have a custom designed crossover.</p>

<p>Generic crossover boards use very simple textbook high and low pass filters. If you want to have a go with a generic crossover board, you can maximise your chances of achieving a good result by following these tips:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Look for a full range driver as midwoofer - you can run it without the tweeter as a fallback option</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>An alternative is to use a widerange driver or at least a midwoofer with a very smooth response that extends well beyond the crossover point</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Choose a tweeter that has extended response below the crossover point as well as a smooth response</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Drivers should have similar sensitivity</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Consider experimenting with an Lpad.&nbsp;Simply add a 10w resistor in between the crossover board and the positive tweeter input terminal. For an 8 ohm tweeter, a 1 ohm resistor will attenuate by 1 dB, 2 ohms &gt; 2 dB. For a 4 ohm tweeter, only 0.5 ohms is required for 1 dB of attenuation.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>It's important to have realistic expectations in a project such as this. The result probably won't be your last speaker but this could be your entry point into a very rewarding speaker building hobby.</p>
